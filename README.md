FEval: Finite Element Evaluation library
========================================

The Finite Element Evaluation library aims at making life easier by 
providing some handy functionality:

o The easy transformation of finite element files between different 
  data formats in order to allow coupling of different codes.
o The precise evaluation of finite element results in the physical space.
o Easy access to different data visualisation and plotting packages.
